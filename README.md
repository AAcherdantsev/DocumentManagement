# Task description
- You are tasked with developing a high-performance document management service for a global organization with branches
worldwide.
- The goal is to design and implement a production-ready ASP.NET Core application that exposes a RESTful API for storing and
retrieving documents in multiple formats.

The solution must be entirely developer-authored â€” code generated by AI is strictly prohibited.
  1. Full CRUD implementation.
  2. Response format follows the request header (JSON, XML, MessagePack,...)
  3. It must be easily extensible for other formats.
  4. It must be easily extensible for data stores such as cloud, HDD, InMemory, SQL, etc.
  5. The document has mandatory fields id, tags a data as shown below. Design the other fields.
  6. Demonstrate the ability to write unit tests.
  7. Assume that the load on this service will be very high (mostly reads).

```
POST http://localhost:5000/documents
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
{
  "id": "some-unique-identifier1",
  "created": "creation-datetime",
  "tags": ["important", ".net"]
  "data": {
    "some": "data",
    "optional": "fields",
    ...
  }
}

GET http://localhost:5000/documents/some-unique-identifier1
Accept: application/xml
```
